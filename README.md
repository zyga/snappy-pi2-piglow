## Raspberry Pi 2 Piglow (using the I2C skill)

NOTE: This repository is a work-in-progress. The I2C skill is neither merged
into snappy nor supported by Canonical. The repository serves as a way to share
ongoing work into this area.

# Installation

To install this snap on a 16.04 snappy device, run:

```
sudo snappy install pi2-piglow.zygoon
```

# Usage

Stay tuned, this currently requires code that is not merged into snappy. I will update usage instructions when it is possible to use on a vanilla installation of snappy.

# Demo
